# mentorship-tracking-system

Mentor Mentee Tracking System, where mentors are able to track their mentees' progress. 

Mentors are able to create a task, manage their mentees' tasks, see their mentees' time table, and communicate with them for any questions about each specific task. 

Mentees are able to see tasks that are created by their mentor; manage their status of a task; communicate with customer representative and mentors for any questions; and track their working hours.
